# GothUI implementation handoff

## Implemented

- Embedded, concurrent-safe CSS handler with ETag revalidation, GET/HEAD,
  explicit mount path, and no directory listing.
- Original semantic CSS: light/dark/system themes, responsive grids, buttons,
  cards, native forms/disclosures, tables, visible focus, and reduced-motion rules.
- Typed templ sources and generated Go for layout, theme toggle, buttons, links,
  cards, forms, input/select/checkbox controls, and grids.
- Native form theme switching with validated cookies, cross-origin protection,
  and an HTTP-level HTMX refresh contract. No bundled JavaScript.
- Runnable showcase, compiled quick-start snippet, MIT licensing and Pico attribution.

The operator explicitly accepted templ as the only direct Go dependency and
no Node/npm/bundled JavaScript. The pinned runtime requires Go 1.26.0 or newer.
The module is `github.com/Tend-Stack/GothUI/v2026` so the requested annual
`v2026.1.0` tag will be compatible with Go semantic import versioning.

## Verification on 2026-11-05

- `templ fmt .`: passed, six source files.
- `templ generate`: passed; generated Go is included.
- `go test -race ./...`: passed for all three packages.
- `go vet ./...`: passed.
- README's complete main.go snippet: compiled using `go test` in a temporary
  package; temporary package removed afterward.
- Runtime dependency inspection: only the standard library and templ packages.

Tests exercise asset mounting, caching, HEAD/404/405 responses, concurrent
requests under the race detector, escaping, unsafe link rejection, optional
HTMX attributes, semantic slots, labeled controls, selected/checked states,
cookie theme round trips, the HTMX response header, request methods, and
cross-origin POST rejection.

Live browser verification is outstanding. The sandbox refused the example's
TCP listener (`socket: operation not permitted`). The example compiled and its
real HTTP handler was exercised in-process via httptest; this is not browser
or visual validation. No example process remains running.

The system's `/snap/bin/go` wrapper also refused to run in this sandbox. Checks
used the existing `/snap/go/current/bin/go` executable (Go 1.27.3) and, for templ
formatting, placed that directory first in PATH. No system installation changed.

## Repository delivery remains outstanding

The nested project has its own Git repository and these remotes:

- github: https://github.com/Tend-Stack/GothUI.git

restricted shell. The GitHub connector reported an empty, private, unarchived
content or repository settings were changed, and no release tag was created.

Next owner: the developer continuing this task with repository network access.
this independent initial history over it. Unarchive only if necessary for the
requested conversion. Rerun affected checks after integration, validate the
showcase in a browser with scripts disabled at desktop/mobile sizes and both
themes, and publish matching commits to both remotes. Then create the first
annual release tag. Private module installation also requires authentication;
repository visibility has deliberately not been changed.

## Housekeeping

The parent `pico-main/`, `pico-main.zip`, and `converzation` are operator inputs
and remain untouched. This nested checkout is the deliverable, not a disposable
worktree. No backups, extra worktrees, databases, or dependency installs were
created. The task-owned temporary Go build cache and quick-start compilation
fixture were removed after validation.

Small logs under `tests/results/` are ignored by Git and retained as local
verification evidence. The next task owner may replace them on the next run or
remove them after delivery; this file preserves the useful result summary.
